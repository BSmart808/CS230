- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client, The Gaming Room, wanted a web-based application that could host their game "Draw it or Lose it" across multiple platforms like iOS, Android, and the web. The game needed to support multiple users and maintain game states across each session
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I was able to clearly define the project requirements, breaking down functionalities needed, providing suggestions for the appropriate OS, store management, memory management, and security.
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Creating the design document was important for the development process. It provided a clear roadmap, setting a foundation for code, laying out challenges, and highlighting dependancies.
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If there was one thing I could revise it would be the evalution. I feel like I could have provided more details and information about each OS and development tools.
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   I interpret the user's needs as one of, if not the most, important things in the development process. I have to constantly make sure that users enjoy what we have designed. It's imperative to put the user first, because disregarding their needs it defeats the purpose of making the application. I'm not 
  designing the project for myself. If the user doesn't like the application, other people will be less inclined to play it, and the client will lose money
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  My approach involved a detailed desgin document. I believe using UML diagrams in the future is very important to break down exactly how the code operates or should be operated
